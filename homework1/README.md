# Machine Learning - Homework 1: Assembly Functions classification

In this homework, I provided a solution for the binary functions classification
problem described in the seminar "_Machine Learning and Security Research_",
using the data sets available in the links below.

- [Dataset 2 (without duplicates)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1olYSZIqHbKQQh__l222cwDj33n3h-zAk)

The code used to solve the problem is avaiable in `homework1.py`.

You can also find a report describing the implemented solution in `report.pdf`,
with the data preprocessing, the feature extraction, the evaluation methods and some final comparisons.
