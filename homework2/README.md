# Machine Learning - Homework 2: Images classification

In this homework, I provided a solution based on **Convolutional Neural Networks**
for an image classification problem with objects typically available in a home environment.
The dataset contains 8221 samples and it's based on a 8 classes subset of the
[RoboCup@Home-Objects dataset](https://sites.google.com/diag.uniroma1.it/robocupathome-objects/home).

The code used to solve the problem is avaiable in `homework2.ipynb`.

You can also find a report describing the implemented solution in `report.pdf`,
with the data preprocessing, the implemented Networks, the evaluation methods and some final comparisons.
