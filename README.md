# Machine Learning - Homework 1: Function classification

In this homework, you are invited to provide a solution for the function classification problem described in the seminar "_Machine Learning and Security Research_", using the data set available in the link below.

Dataset 1: with duplicates

Dataset 2: without duplicates

To solve the problem, you can use any method, any tool, any programming language. Exception: you cannot use solutions based on neural networks, as this will be the topic of Homework 2. It is your choice to pre-process the input data in any way it is useful for the method you are using. In particular, the use of the control flow graph is optional.

The output of the assignment should be:
1. A report (PDF file of about 10 pages, with your name and matricola code) describing the implemented solution: how data have been preprocessed, which method/algorithm has been used, which configurations of the method have been tried, description of the evaluation method used, and obtained results using appropriate metrics. The report should compare at least two different solutions, obtained, for example, by changing the value of an hyper-parameter of the used method, by testing different ways of preprocessing, etc. Conclusions should discuss the comparative results. Computational training time can also be interesting to report and comment.
2. A ZIP file with the code you used in the project.
3. A text file named _yourmatricola_.txt (e.g., 1234567.txt) with the output of the blind test: one label (math, sort, encryption, string) per line corresponding to the samples in the blind test set (keeping the given order).
Results on the blind test will be ordered in a leaderboard where you can see the results you obtained in comparison with other students.

Submit the three files in this assignment, Make sure to turn the assignment in, otherwise it will not reach the teachers.
**NOTE**: do not put the PDF report into the ZIP file!!!

This assignment must be individual (i.e., one submission for each student) and original (i.e., not equal or too similar to other works either from other students in this class or from other sources). Evaluation will be based on the appropriateness and correctness of the described solution, regardless of the numeric results (as long as they are reasonable). The results on the blind test also do not affect the evaluation of this homework.

Deadline: 29/11/2020 11:59 PM CET
