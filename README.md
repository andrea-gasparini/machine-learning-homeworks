# Machine Learning homeworks (A.Y. 2020-2021)
This repository contains the two homeworks developed for the course Machine Learning @ Sapienza University of Rome.

## Homework 1: Assembly Functions classification

In this homework, I provided a solution for the binary functions classification
problem described in the seminar "_Machine Learning and Security Research_",
using the data sets available in the links below.

- [Dataset 1 (with duplicates)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vKT9OzJwM6gKACyElzECW49X5nFeVxad)
- [Dataset 2 (without duplicates)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1olYSZIqHbKQQh__l222cwDj33n3h-zAk)

**Final score:** 2/2

## Homework 2: Images classification

In this homework, I provided a solution based on **Convolutional Neural Networks**
for an image classification problem with objects typically available in a home environment.
The dataset contains 8221 samples and it's based on a 8 classes subset of the
[RoboCup@Home-Objects dataset](https://sites.google.com/diag.uniroma1.it/robocupathome-objects/home).

**Final score:** 2/2
